Project with C# and React

This is a personal project I created after a learning experience during a technical interview. The test involved building a CRUD application using C# and React, but I struggled with completing it successfully. To improve my skills, I followed a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp.org and decided to create this project as part of my learning journey.

The project demonstrates a simple application built with a C# ASP.NET Core backend and a React.js frontend. It highlights the following features:

- Backend: Developed with ASP.NET Core, exposing RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations.
- Frontend: Built using React.js, fetching and displaying data from the backend dynamically.
- API Consumption: Integration of backend APIs in the frontend to manage data with fetch/axios requests.
- Learning Outcome: Deepened my understanding of C# backend development, React components, routing, and API integration.
